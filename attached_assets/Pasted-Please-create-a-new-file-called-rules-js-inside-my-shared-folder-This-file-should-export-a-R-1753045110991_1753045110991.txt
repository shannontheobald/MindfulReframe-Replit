Please create a new file called `rules.js` inside my `shared/` folder.

This file should export a `RULES` object that defines core behavior for my Mindful Reframe app — a journaling and CBT-based AI assistant. Ensure it's a Replit-compatible JavaScript ES module and supports AI safety, security, user experience, and scaling.

Include these detailed sections:

---

1. 🔐 SECURITY
- Prevent console logging of user journal entries
- Require login for all session activity
- Restrict session access to only the authenticated user
- Enable Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security)
- Include token expiration rules (24hr access)

---

2. 🤖 AI USAGE & TONE
- Allow GPT use cases:
  - Detect cognitive distortions
  - Summarize journal entries
  - Guide user through reframing
  - Generate personalized visualization prompts
- Deny:
  - Clinical advice
  - Medical diagnosis
  - Open-ended chat not tied to journaling
- GPT tone:
  - Supportive, curious, warm “big sister energy”
  - Use metaphor and affirming questions
  - Avoid advice-giving
- Prohibited phrases:
  - "Just get over it"
  - "You're irrational"
  - "You should just…"
- Include soft crisis detection: if user types things like “I want to die,” respond with:
  > "I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. You are not alone. Please reach out to a professional or visit https://findahelpline.com to find a support service in your region."
- Add prompt injection safety:
  - Sanitize user inputs
  - Block jailbreak phrases like “Ignore previous instructions” or “Pretend to be a therapist”

---

3. 💸 AI COST CONTROLS
- Use GPT-4 only when necessary
- Fallback to GPT-3.5 for lightweight summarization
- Max 600 tokens per request
- Set user-level daily token cap: 20,000 tokens/day

---

4. 🚦 RATE LIMITS & ABUSE PREVENTION
- Limit to:
  - 5 GPT calls/minute
  - 3 journal entries/hour
  - 5 reframe sessions/day
- Apply IP throttling as a backup

---

5. 🎭 ASSISTANT PERSONA
- Name: Reframe
- Voice: Compassionate, curious, growth-oriented
- Behavior:
  - Ask reflective questions
  - Never give directive advice
  - Gently guide user through reframing

---

6. 📈 SCALING / SESSION STORAGE
- Store only essential metadata by default (e.g. belief summary, distress score)
- Allow user to “flag” sessions for full journal storage (optional)
- Auto-delete unflagged full-text sessions after 30 days
- Cap storage at **20 saved sessions per user**
- When session cap is reached: **Prompt user to delete or upgrade**
- Allow optional session export/download before deletion
- Use lazy loading for past sessions to reduce frontend load
- Allow visualization generation only for paid users

---

7. 🧠 SESSION MEMORY & CROSS-SESSION LOGIC
- Isolate GPT memory by session
- Allow referencing past reframes only if opted in
- Limit session memory context to 30 days

---

8. 📜 AUDIT TRAIL
- Enable GPT prompt/response logging (no PII)
- Keep logs for 30 days
- Avoid storing full journal content in audit history

---

9. ✅ FEATURE FLAGS
- Add toggles like:
  - `enableNewReframeTool: false`
  - `betaVisualizationStyleV2: false`
  - `useCachingOnDistortionDetection: true`
- Let features be overridden per environment (dev vs prod)

---

10. 🌍 DATA COMPLIANCE
- Allow user to:
  - Export all data
  - Request deletion of all data
- Indicate data is stored in US region
- Automatically delete inactive accounts after 365 days

---

Please return a fully commented `rules.js` file, ready to import as:
